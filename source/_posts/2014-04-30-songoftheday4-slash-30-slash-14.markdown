My first song of the day goes out to me! I'm happy because I finally finished http://www.grooveunion.com and have it live and functional.  Yet, I realize I still have a lot of work to do to perfect the website.  Just like the song, coding can get repetitive and tiresome.  But screw it because I'm happy!
