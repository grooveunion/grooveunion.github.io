It is hard to find a more entertaining show out there than the Avett Brothers. Their stage presence is undeniable and has your heart racing from the first beat to the last beat. Whether they are stomping on the stage or hopping around, they will leave you wanting more. This was not the first time I have seen the Avett Brothers at White River, but I must say I enjoyed this year’s show compared to last time there three years ago. However, this was mostly due to the show being outdoors in the middle of October. I had trouble enjoying the show because I was struggling to keep myself warm the entire show.

This time around, I could not have asked for better weather. It was perfect outside, and they killed it with a twenty-four song set list. They started out strong with some well-known songs like ‘Live and Die’ and ‘Pretty Girl from Cedar Lane’ before settling down with songs like ‘Vanity’ and ‘Laundry Room’. Right after ‘Vanity’, they busted out my personal favorite ‘Kick Drum Heart’ which had the crowd back up and dancing after a few slow ones.
	
One thing I do remember about the show a few years ago were the uniquely chosen covers like Neutral Milk Hotel’s ‘In the Aeroplane Over the Sea’. No Neutral Milk Hotel this time, but they did however cover a pretty fun George Jones song called ‘The Race Is On’. I had not heard this one before, but I liked it. The same could be said about the first song of the encore which was a Doc Watson cover called ‘Little Sadie’.  They closed the show out with the crowd favorite and ever-popular ‘I and Love and You’. This was the same song they closed with last time I saw them, and I would not have had it any other way this time around. It is such a pretty melodic song with outstanding lyrics that had the whole crowd singing along.

I do not know the Avett Brothers catalog as well as a lot of other bands I listen to, but they always put on an incredible show. With unmatched energy and a style that hits a few different musical genres, they are able to keep the set lists fresh and exciting. This concert-goer will be 100% going back to see the Avett Brothers next time they are in Indiana.
