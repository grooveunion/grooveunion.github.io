The Roots have unveiled the music video for their latest single "Understand".  The song is from the album titled "And Then You Shoot Your Cousin, which is due out May 20th.  The video is an absolutely stunning stop motion clip that follows around several objects.  The video is intentionally trippy and pretty difficult to, dare I say it, understand?
