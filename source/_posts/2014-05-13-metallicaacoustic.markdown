Last night in Los Angeles at the 10th anniversary MusiCares MAP Fund benefit concert for addiction treatment, Metallica performed an acoustic set in honor of Ozzy Osbourne.  Osbourne was being celebrated with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award for his commitment to helping people who have struggled with addiction.

I'm not really sure which one is more odd: Metallica doing an acoustic set or Metallica doing an acoustic set in honor of Ozzy Osbourne?  It just.... doesn't seem to fit.

The award was presented to Osbourne by Eagles guitarist Joe walsh, who called Osbourne "the grandfather of heavy metal."

Osbourne's band closed out the night and began its performance with "I don't know," with Dave Navarro playing guitar.  Ozzie being Ozzie, he decided the crowd wasn't lively enough.  "You could look like you're having a bit more fun," he joked as he tossed a bucket of cold water into the crowd.  I mean there weren't any bats around to bite the head off of so a bucket of cold water to the crowd was going to have to suffice.  "Was I really so bad all these years that they're giving me an award for being sober?" Yes Ozzie, yes you were.

Slash joined Osbourne on stage for the final song "Paranoid," but Osbourne was still not happy with the crowd telling them: "Don't get too crazy.  You might enjoy yourselves."

Maybe the crowd just had no clue what he was saying the entire time.

The MusiCares MAP Fund provides members of the music community access to addiction recovery treatment regardless of their financial situation.  It also offers support groups and sober living resources for working members.
