The Foo Fighters have confirmed their eighth studio album which will arrive this fall.  The release of the untitled record will coincide with the airing of Dave Grohl's new HBO series.  The series will film Foo Fighter's recording sessions in eight different cities: Chicago, Austin, Nashville, Los Angeles, Seattle, New Orleans, Washington, DC and New York.

The press release explains: “One song was recorded in each city, every song featuring local legends sitting in, and every lyric written in an unprecedented experimental style: Dave held off on putting down words until the last day of each session, so as to be inspired by the experiences, interviews and personalities that became part of the process.

“Each episode delves into the singular regional identity of each city-how each region shaped these musicians in their formative years, and in turn the impact those people had on the cultural fabric of their hometowns-ultimately celebrating their common bond: Every artist that appears in the show, regardless of genre or locale, started as an average kid with the universal dreams of making music and making it big.”

Long live The Foo!
