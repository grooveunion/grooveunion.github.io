Via [Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lionel-richie-promises-country-sequel-20140606), Lionel Richie promises his next album will be country.  “It's coming,” he told Rolling Stone backstage at Wednesday's CMT Awards.  The planning for the country album has been going on since the making of 'Tuskegee', in which he sang numerous duets with some of country's biggest stars (Blake Shelton, Shania Twain, Kenny Chesney, Willie Nelson).

"You cannot not be inspired," he said of joining the country music scene. "What I'm missing in the pop world and in the R&B world are great songs. And whether I want to admit it or not, country's writing songs that are sticking around for the next 400 years. They're writing music. And so, this is my heaven. When my record company came back and said, 'Would you consider another one? How do you feel about country?' I said, 'Well it's pop music to me.'  So I'm going to stay around here for a while. I love all of my new friends. My 'brand new old friends,' as I call them."
