According to Tommy Lee, Billy Corgan is about to deliver “the best record he’s ever written.” Lee, who is drumming on Smashing Pumpkins’ forthcoming LP *Monuments To An Elegy*, spoke to Billboard about the recording process. He added, “These are like epic, goose-bump songs. It sounds like the first couple of Smashing Pumpkins records. I was fucking blown away.”

Corgan previously said he expects the album, along with a second Pumpkins LP called Day For Night, to be released in 2015. He described the albums’ sound by saying, “think: ‘guitars, guitars, guitars, and more guitars;’ but more so on the epic side of things than say, grossly metallic.”
