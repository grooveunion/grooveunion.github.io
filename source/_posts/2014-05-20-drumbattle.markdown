One week from today, On May 22nd, the people will get what they want.  Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and his look-a-like Will Ferrell will have a drum off on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.

Last February, during a Reddit AMA Ferrell wrote "A lot of people think that it's me playing for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  But that would be an insult to Chad Smith.  The truth of the matter is there is no Will Ferrell.  Only Chad Smith."

Smith issued a challenge to Ferrell in response: "Stop impersonating me.  In fact, I need you... drum battle.  Me and You.  I've seen your skills; you don't got 'em.  Let's Go.  Golden cowbell. Winner. Boom!"

Ferrell accepted the offer on the condition they raise $300,000 for the charities Cancer for College and Little Kids Rock, which has already been accomplished.

In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Smith expressed confidence:  I'm all for it.  But unless Will's been practicing or is secretly a crazy, wild drummer, I think it'll be evident right off the bat who the real Chad Smith is.  I'm ready to take him down."
