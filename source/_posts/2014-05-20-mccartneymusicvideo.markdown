Today, Paul McCartney released his new video for *Appreciate* in support of his latest LP, *New*.  Guest starring in the video is Newman the Robot.

The video begins with Newman walking around an office before him and McCartney fall into an epic staredown.  McCartney breaks the silence and begins singing to Newman.  The rest of the video, Paul and Newman are dancing around, enjoying themselves like two peas in a pod.  That didn't take long for a friendship to come together.  Paul and Newman, Newman and Paul.  A match made in heaven.  watch the video below.
