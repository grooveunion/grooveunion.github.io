I can't say I don't enjoy seeing Jay Z getting assaulted.  Anybody with that much influence and power needs to be beaten down a few notches usually.  I also enjoy seeing his security guards half heartedly protect him against the attempted beatdown.  Especially when everyone starts to walk out of the elevator and they just leave them two behind to duke it out some more.  Yea I get they were trying to act normal for the crowd, but thats breaking up fights 101.  You don't leave the two high school kids in the same room after a fight.  "Here kids sit down next to each other and we'll figure out what to do with you in the other room."  Of course in a few minutes they'll be beating the shit out of each other again.  

She's probably pissed she got such a shitty end of the stick with the Knowles family.  She doesn't have the looks, her names Solange, and she doesn't get to sit courtside at Nets games.
