Recently, Bob Dylan posted a new cover of Frank Sinatra's "Full Moon and Empty Arms" on his website.  The song is expected to be part of a forthcoming album due later on this year.

There is no confirmed album title, however, on Dylan's homepage there is an image of Dylan with the phrase "Shadows in the Night".  The image is without a doubt a hint at a possible album cover and title.

The music fan in me is excited about the possibilities of yet another Dylan album.   However, the cynic in me can only hope that Bob Dylan can somehow use modern technology to shadow his ever fading voice and musical spirit.
