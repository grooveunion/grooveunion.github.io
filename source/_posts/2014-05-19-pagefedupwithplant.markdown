Jimmy Page it seems, is just as annoyed at the lack of a Led Zeppelin reunion as the rest of us normies are.  In response to Robert Plant's comments a few weeks ago about not wanting to be "part of a jukebox", Page said he feels Plant is just jerking the bands chains.

"I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think?  Well, he knows what the other guys think.  Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band.  He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, to be honest with you.  I don't sing, so I can't do much about it."

Page then reiterated his desire to play live as Led Zeppelin again.  "Absolutely, absolutely.  I definitely want to play live.  Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye.  I can still play.  So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar."

Even though the Led Zeppelin reunion seems very unlikely, Page said he like to play with someone, somewhere in the near future.  "I'm not devoid of ideas.  So let's hope that some time in the next year, I'm seen to be playing out there.  Because that's the only thing that's been missing."

Lately, Page has been focusing on upcoming reissues of Zeppelin's first three records.  "This is a wealth of musical content and attitudes and variations," he stated.  "That passing on of the baton, if you like, is part of the whole thing."
