Last night, Prince performed three shows in the span of five hours for a small club of people in Brussles, Belgium.  Prince has been known to put on unique performances and continues to suprise and thrill fans.  Every performance and special show Prince does proves how much he truly loves playing music. 

(My favorite Prince moment.  I love when he just tosses the guitar up when he's done.  who catches it? Did it ever land?)
