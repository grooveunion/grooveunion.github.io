Michael Jackson is set to appear in hologram form at Sunday's Billboard Music Awards.  Billboard originally hinted at the holographic appearance when they promised a "world premiere experience" from Jackson.  

Is there anything more disrespectful to Michael Jackson and his abilities, than to present him in hologram form?  I mean, we don't even know which Michael Jackson is going to show up.  Will it be the black moonwalking Jackson?  Will it be the white ghoulish figure that we saw from the Bad album and on?  Will it be baby Michael?  I for one vote for baby Michael.  That's the only Michael Jackson hologram I believe I could tolerate.  Little Michael up there singing and dancing, and still looking like a normal human being.  If any other Michael shows up it's all a sham.
