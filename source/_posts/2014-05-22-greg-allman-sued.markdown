SAVANNAH, Ga.- Greg Allman is one of 18 parties being sued by the parents of a young camera assistant who died during the production of "Midnight Rider," a movie based on Allman's memoir.  The crew was struck by a freight train in southeast Georgia.

The parents of 27-year old Sarah Jones filed a lawsuit that names 10 individuals associated with the film.  Including Allman, director Randall Miller, his production company, as well as CSX railroad.

“They did so many wrong things on so many levels, it’s just unbelievable,” Richard Jones said. “This should not have happened. It’s senseless.”  The lawsuit accuses all parties of negligence and seeks unspecified monetary damages.
