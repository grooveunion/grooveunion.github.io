Via [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-rr-martin-contest-winner-709769), for a mere $20,000 you can be wrote in and killed off of *A Song of Ice and Fire* by George RR Martin.  The $20,000 is raising funds for Santa Fe's Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, along with the local Food Depot of Santa Fe.  There will be one male and one female wrote in and subsequently killed off, and they are each allowed to choose their characters class in the world (lord, knight, peasant, whore, lady, maester, septon, etc.)

For the not-so-rich, other prizes include eating breakfast with Martin himself ($15,000), attending the TV series' Season 5 premiere ($7,500), and basically buying one of Martin's signature hats for $7,500.  The fundraiser was developed by Martin and his wife, Parris McBride.

Who would've thought Martin and his wife would be into wolves?
