Jack White obviously does not like the black keys.  In a new interview with [Rolling Stone](http://rollingstone.com/), White did not have kind words for the 2-man “copycat” band, as White would claim. “There are kids at school who dress like everybody else, because they don’t know what to do, and there are musicians like that, too,” White said. “I’ll hear TV commercials where the music’s ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it’s me. Half the time, it’s The Black Keys. The other half, it’s a sound-alike song because they couldn’t license one of mine. There’s a whole world that’s totally fine with the watered-down version of the original.” 

The no love lost relationship dates back to the summer of 2013 when TMZ released email exchanges between White and his wife Karen Elson.  “My concern with Auerbach is because I don’t want the kids involved in any of that crap. You aren’t thinking ahead. That’s a possible twelve fucking years I’m going to have to be sitting in kids chairs next to that asshole with other people trying to lump us in together. He gets yet another free reign to follow me around and copy me and push himself into my world.” 

Jack White will not allow another two-piece band to steal any of the White Stripes former glory.
