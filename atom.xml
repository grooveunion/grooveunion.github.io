JACK JOHNSON CONCERT REVIEW
<br/ >
6/1/2014 The Lawn at White River State Park
<br/ >
Support: Amos Lee

</div>




<br/ >


<p>Anybody that lives in Indiana knows that you never know what the weather could be like at any given hour at a time. Last night, the Jack Johnson concert on the Lawn at White River State Park proved this point even further. Yesterday started as a beautiful day only for the weathermen to announce late in the day that severe weather was coming and was going to hit hard until about 8:45PM. The opener, Amos Lee, came on and played about three songs before they kicked him off the stage and urged everyone to exit the venue and seek shelter at approximately 7:45. It was barely drizzling and partly cloudy with a handful of lightning bolts. However, the masses started the mass exodus to neighboring buildings to catch a few drinks before heading back to the Lawn and catch Jack’s set which the venue stated they were sure would still happen.</p>

<p>Well, the rain never came and everyone started pouring back into the venue about 20-30 minutes after the announcement was made telling everyone to leave. It never did end up raining, ended up feeling perfect outside, and Jack still played an entire two-hour set beginning at 9PM that covered everything from his first album to his newest album along with some excellent covers.</p>

<p>I have seen Jack multiple times, and every time I get worried Jack is going to stick to new material during his set and steer away from his older hits that made me fall in love with Jack originally. This was definitely not the case. He had a perfect balance of old hits, new hits, and covers nicely placed throughout the set. It also was amazing that his band supporting him was members of ALO (Animal Liberation Orchestra), who is also a band on the same label as Jack. They added an extra something to the show that would not have been the same without them.</p>

<p>Most people get the impression that a Jack Johnson show would be a boring, quiet show that is not very upbeat. Jack kept the crowd into it the entire time and was even listening and playing requests that were screamed out from the crowd! Not only that, he even played a song the crowd was screaming for all night that was actually an ALO song. It is nice when a popular musician like Jack can put his ego aside and give the fans what they want, and Jack was definitely showing this side of him to his fans last night and you could tell the crowd loved it.</p>

<p>It was a bummer to a lot of Amos Lee fans in attendance that his set got cut short. However, Jack made right by bringing him and his band on stage multiple times to play with him along with 2 or 3 songs in the encore. To end the show, Jack had the members from ALO, Amos Lee and his band, and himself on stage to close the set. There were a lot of people on stage at that moment, but it was amazing how fluent and great they all sounded together like they had been doing it for years!</p>

<p>A Jack Johnson concert is never going to be the best concert you have ever seen, nor will it ever be the worst concert you have ever seen. But it has always entertained me in a big way and I leave happy and satisfied every time. Jack has never changed his musical style unlike many artists today, and he should be commended for that. I saw Jack about 8 years ago, again about 4 years ago, and now last night. It has gotten better and better each time, and I will continue to go see him as long as he continues to tour!</p>

<p>Last night, Prince performed three shows in the span of five hours for a small club of people in Brussles, Belgium.  Prince has been known to put on unique performances and continues to suprise and thrill fans.  Every performance and special show Prince does proves how much he truly loves playing music.</p>

<p>(My favorite Prince moment.  I love when he just tosses the guitar up when he&rsquo;s done.  who catches it? Did it ever land?)</p>

<p>Jack White obviously does not like the black keys.  In a new interview with <a href="http://rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a>, White did not have kind words for the 2-man “copycat” band, as White would claim. “There are kids at school who dress like everybody else, because they don’t know what to do, and there are musicians like that, too,” White said. “I’ll hear TV commercials where the music’s ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it’s me. Half the time, it’s The Black Keys. The other half, it’s a sound-alike song because they couldn’t license one of mine. There’s a whole world that’s totally fine with the watered-down version of the original.”</p>

<p>The no love lost relationship dates back to the summer of 2013 when TMZ released email exchanges between White and his wife Karen Elson.  “My concern with Auerbach is because I don’t want the kids involved in any of that crap. You aren’t thinking ahead. That’s a possible twelve fucking years I’m going to have to be sitting in kids chairs next to that asshole with other people trying to lump us in together. He gets yet another free reign to follow me around and copy me and push himself into my world.”</p>

<p>Jack White will not allow another two-piece band to steal any of the White Stripes former glory.</p>

<p>SAVANNAH, Ga.&ndash; Greg Allman is one of 18 parties being sued by the parents of a young camera assistant who died during the production of &ldquo;Midnight Rider,&rdquo; a movie based on Allman&rsquo;s memoir.  The crew was struck by a freight train in southeast Georgia.</p>

<p>The parents of 27-year old Sarah Jones filed a lawsuit that names 10 individuals associated with the film.  Including Allman, director Randall Miller, his production company, as well as CSX railroad.</p>

<p>“They did so many wrong things on so many levels, it’s just unbelievable,” Richard Jones said. “This should not have happened. It’s senseless.”  The lawsuit accuses all parties of negligence and seeks unspecified monetary damages.</p>

<p>As an avid festival goer for the past decade, I can say with confidence that Summer Camp Music Festival is the place to be this year. With its best lineup ever, latest daily band schedule with the main stages playing until 2AM, and longest band list to date, you do not want to miss it! Summer Camp Music Festival is a 3-day festival held every year over Memorial weekend in Chillicothe, IL (just outside of Peoria). Summer Camp began in 2001 with a bill of only 11 bands. In its 14th year, the festival will host more than 125 bands next month. Last week, Rolling Stone magazine even named Summer Camp as one of the “Summer 2014’s 40 Must-See Music Festivals”.</p>

<p>This writer has been to more than 10 different festivals across the county, and will be attending my 7th Summer Camp this year with my first having been in 2008. Instead of writing a post talking about how many amazing bands are going to be there and who they are, this post is intended to shed light on the changes that Summer Camp has made in the past 7 years to make this one of the premiere festivals in the country. Besides, a lineup including 3 nights of Moe., 3 nights of Umphrey’s Mcgee, 2 sets of Trey Anastasio Band, Primus, G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, Blues Traveler, The Wood Brothers, Yonder Mountain String Band, and Keller Williams should pretty much speak for itself in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>There have been so many positive changes to the festival since 2008 that the first or second-time Summer Camp goer would have no clue about! This is one of the only festivals in the country that listen to the feedback from people that attend the festival and actually make the desired changes. Don’t get me wrong, there are still some major changes in my opinion that would help the festival tremendously. However, the changes that have been made since 2008 have helped the festival in more ways than I could have hoped to imagine.</p>

<p>The biggest difference that has helped Summer Camp become more “user-friendly” is the set up at the festival entrance. My first year in 2008, we went on the Thursday for the Pre-Party and sat in line for at least 4-5 hours before even getting inside the festival (after we had already parked). It was one, giant line that wrapped all the way around into the parking lot. The security check, wristbands, late night tickets, EVERYTHING was all in ONE single line all while baking in the hot sun with fully loaded wagons, carts, arms, bags, backpacks, etc. It was a nightmare to say the least. By the time we got through the line, half the day was already over. Now, flash-forward to 2014. There’s a separate pod for your tickets before you get in the line, along with a handful of lanes at the security checkpoint instead of just one. It has saved hours upon hours of waiting time at the entrance and is so much more fluid.</p>

<p>The next big thing that helped was a very subtle change that most people probably thought was no big deal. For the first five years I attended Summer Camp, there was only one way in and one way out of the main stage at the festival off to the side (Moonshine). Last year, they created a big hole/path in the back of Moonshine Stage so that you can walk straight through the back which gives a direct line to the other main stage (Sunshine). And for people like me, this was huge because our campsite was between Moonshine and Sunshine right behind the Moonshine stage behind this newly created path.</p>

<p>The last major difference I’d like to bring up is one that rookie Summer Campers may have no clue about. The location of Sunshine stage has been in a new location the past two years in comparison to years past. The location of where Sunshine used to be is now more area for camping. They moved the stage further out in a parallel fashion to expand the boundaries of the festival which has helped tremendously for this growing festival. Moving the stage allowed for more people to attend the festival, it is not as cramped in the camping area, and it has created more standing room for the stages.</p>

<p>What am I most excited for this year at Summer Camp in my 7th year that will be different from the rest of the years I have attended? THE SCHEDULE! Two of the most heartbreaking things about Summer Camp in the past have been the main stages only playing until 10 or 11PM each year and how you have to have additional tickets for the late night shows in the red barn which always end up being headlining acts like Umphrey’s Mcgee and Moe. I will be going down a new path this year at Summer Camp by finally springing for VIP tickets. There are a lot of perks that make VIP worthwhile that I could get into, but possibly my favorite perk is my choice of one late night ticket in the red barn. I have tried the past 6 years to see a show in the barn, but only got lucky enough to get into only one show. This year, I have my late night ticket and am ready to go. As for the schedule, the main stages will be going until 2AM this year, which will make Summer Camp even better and I did not think that was possible.</p>

<p>Now if we can just get the folks that put on Summer Camp to pave the parking lots as well as keep all the torrential rain away that have dampened (literally) 3 of my last 6 Summer Camps, then this festival would be absolutely perfect. Don’t get me wrong, every time it has rained I have still had the time of my life. But, it did take my girlfriend some talking into for this year. It took me seven years, but this year I will be ready for the rain. I will be ready with my rain suit and men’s rain boots (yes that’s a real thing).</p>

<p>The GrooveUnion squad will all be in attendance next weekend for Summer Camp, and we will be reporting back to our readers about the best moments, sets, bands, and experiences that we have this year at the best festival on the planet! Stay tuned, and stay groovy.</p>

The rest of the video, Paul and Newman are dancing around, enjoying themselves like two peas in a pod.  That didn&rsquo;t take long for a friendship to come together.  Paul and Newman, Newman and Paul.  A match made in heaven.  watch the video below.</p>

<p>According to Tommy Lee, Billy Corgan is about to deliver “the best record he’s ever written.” Lee, who is drumming on Smashing Pumpkins’ forthcoming LP <em>Monuments To An Elegy</em>, spoke to Billboard about the recording process. He added, “These are like epic, goose-bump songs. It sounds like the first couple of Smashing Pumpkins records. I was fucking blown away.”</p>

<p>Corgan previously said he expects the album, along with a second Pumpkins LP called Day For Night, to be released in 2015. He described the albums’ sound by saying, “think: ‘guitars, guitars, guitars, and more guitars;’ but more so on the epic side of things than say, grossly metallic.”</p>

<p>The Roots have unveiled the music video for their latest single &ldquo;Understand&rdquo;.  The song is from the album titled &ldquo;And Then You Shoot Your Cousin, which is due out May 20th.  The video is an absolutely stunning stop motion clip that follows around several objects.  The video is intentionally trippy and pretty difficult to, dare I say it, understand?</p>

<p>Michael Jackson is set to appear in hologram form at Sunday&rsquo;s Billboard Music Awards.  Billboard originally hinted at the holographic appearance when they promised a &ldquo;world premiere experience&rdquo; from Jackson.</p>

<p>Is there anything more disrespectful to Michael Jackson and his abilities, than to present him in hologram form?  I mean, we don&rsquo;t even know which Michael Jackson is going to show up.  Will it be the black moonwalking Jackson?  Will it be the white ghoulish figure that we saw from the Bad album and on?  Will it be baby Michael?  I for one vote for baby Michael.  That&rsquo;s the only Michael Jackson hologram I believe I could tolerate.  Little Michael up there singing and dancing, and still looking like a normal human being.  If any other Michael shows up it&rsquo;s all a sham.</p>

<p>One week from today, On May 22nd, the people will get what they want.  Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and his look-a-like Will Ferrell will have a drum off on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.</p>

<p>Last February, during a Reddit AMA Ferrell wrote &ldquo;A lot of people think that it&rsquo;s me playing for the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  But that would be an insult to Chad Smith.  The truth of the matter is there is no Will Ferrell.  Only Chad Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smith issued a challenge to Ferrell in response: &ldquo;Stop impersonating me.  In fact, I need you&hellip; drum battle.  Me and You.  I&rsquo;ve seen your skills; you don&rsquo;t got &lsquo;em.  Let&rsquo;s Go.  Golden cowbell. Winner. Boom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferrell accepted the offer on the condition they raise $300,000 for the charities Cancer for College and Little Kids Rock, which has already been accomplished.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Smith expressed confidence:  I&rsquo;m all for it.  But unless Will&rsquo;s been practicing or is secretly a crazy, wild drummer, I think it&rsquo;ll be evident right off the bat who the real Chad Smith is.  I&rsquo;m ready to take him down.&#8221;</p>
